1. Introduct logistic regression to a person who is not familiar with machine learning
2. Why don't use linear regression to do classification ? if yes, what is the problem. How can logistic regression solve this?
3. Can cost function in logistic regression can be MSE?  My answer is no, non convex
4. Any other interpretation of logistic regression cost function? My answer is max entropy theorm.(However, intervewer doesn't know it...)
   The answer he expects is maximum likehood estimation (damn, i forgot it)
5. image segmentation algorithm? I answered RCNN
6. any classic image segmentation algorithm? I answered watershed
7. He describes one proposal: use kmeans to do image segmentation. basically cluster RGB color (3 features). will it work? i said no, it 
  will lose spatial information
8. General ML:
  a. what is variance and bias 
  b. knn is high variance or high bias?
  c. logistic regression is high variance or high bias if the data is real world data?
  d. what is parameter is knn? I said no parameter, no training, he agrees, he said we can also interpret it as each sample is parameter. (想想其实也对，这样就说明了high variance)
